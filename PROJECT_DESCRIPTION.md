## üéØ Matching Algorithm Deep Dive

### The 7-Step Matching Process

#### Step 1: User Eligibility Filtering
- Verified medical professionals (`is_verified = true`)
- Active subscribers (`is_paid = true`)
- Completed onboarding (`onboarding_completed = true`)
- Joined before Thursday 12:00 PM
- Not matched in past 6 weeks
- Minimum 3 eligible users per city

#### Step 2: Compatibility Scoring
```
match_score = 0.30 √ó specialty_similarity +
              0.40 √ó shared_interest_ratio +
              0.20 √ó same_city +
              0.10 √ó overlapping_availability_ratio
```

#### Step 3: Group Formation
- Greedy algorithm for optimal group creation
- Groups of 3-4 members
- Gender balance enforcement
- Minimum compatibility score of 0.55

#### Step 4: Database Integration
- Creates match records in `matches` table
- Links users via `match_members` table
- Tracks matching history and statistics

#### Step 5: Chat Initialization
- Seeds groups with welcome messages
- Sets up real-time communication channels
- Manages group member permissions

#### Step 6: Notification Preparation
- Generates notification data for each matched user
- Prepares email templates and content
- Queues notifications for delivery

#### Step 7: Unmatched User Handling
- Identifies users who couldn't be matched
- Prioritizes them for next week's matching
- Maintains matching statistics
