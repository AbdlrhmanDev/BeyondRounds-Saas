# 🎯 BeyondRounds Weekly Matching Engine

## Overview

The BeyondRounds Weekly Matching Engine is a production-ready system that automatically matches doctors every Thursday at 16:00 local time. It implements a sophisticated 7-step algorithm that considers medical specialties, shared interests, geographic proximity, and availability to create optimal groups of 3-4 doctors.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **WeeklyMatchingEngine** (`lib/weekly-matching-engine.ts`)
   - Main engine class implementing the 7-step algorithm
   - Handles scoring, grouping, and database operations

2. **CRON Job** (`app/api/cron/weekly-matching/route.ts`)
   - Automated endpoint triggered every Thursday at 16:00
   - Includes authentication and error handling

3. **Database Schema** (Multiple SQL files in `scripts/`)
   - Complete schema with profiles, matches, match_members, chat_messages
   - Indexes and RLS policies for performance and security

4. **Simulation Script** (`scripts/simulate_matching_engine.ts`)
   - Comprehensive testing and demonstration tool

## 🔄 7-Step Matching Process

### ⚙️ Step 1: Fetch Eligible Users

Filters users from `profiles` and `auth.users` tables who meet ALL criteria:

- ✅ `is_verified = true`
- ✅ `is_paid = true` 
- ✅ `onboarding_completed = true`
- ✅ Joined before Thursday 12:00 (check `created_at`)
- ✅ Not matched in past 6 weeks (check `match_members` + `matches.match_week`)
- ✅ From city with ≥ 3 other eligible users

```typescript
const eligibleUsers = await engine.fetchEligibleUsers()
```

### 🧠 Step 2: Score All Valid Pairs

Calculates match scores using the exact specification formula:

```
match_score = 0.30 * specialty_similarity +
              0.40 * shared_interest_ratio +
              0.20 * same_city +
              0.10 * overlapping_availability_ratio
```

**Scoring Breakdown:**
- **Specialty Similarity (30%)**: 1 if same, 0.5 if same domain, 0 otherwise
- **Shared Interest Ratio (40%)**: Ratio of common interests across all categories
- **Same City (20%)**: 1 if same city, 0 otherwise  
- **Availability Overlap (10%)**: Ratio of shared availability slots

Only pairs with `score ≥ 0.55` are kept for grouping.

```typescript
const scoredPairs = engine.scoreAllValidPairs(eligibleUsers)
```

### 🧩 Step 3: Grouping (Greedy Algorithm)

Creates groups of 3-4 using greedy approach:

1. **Start with highest-scoring pair**
2. **Add third/fourth members** if they boost average score ≥ 0.55
3. **Enforce gender balance:**
   - 3-person: 2 of one gender, 1 other
   - 4-person: 2/2 balance preferred
4. **Respect gender preferences** and inclusion of non-binary
5. **No user reuse** within the same round

```typescript
const groups = engine.createGroups(eligibleUsers, scoredPairs)
```

### 🧾 Step 4: Insert Database Records

For each group, inserts records into database:

**Matches Table:**
```sql
INSERT INTO matches (id, group_name, created_at, match_week, status)
VALUES (uuid_generate_v4(), 'Rounds_Group_01', now(), current_date, 'active');
```

**Match Members Table:**
```sql
INSERT INTO match_members (id, match_id, user_id, joined_at)
VALUES (uuid_generate_v4(), [match_id], [user_id], now());
```

```typescript
const { matches, matchMembers } = await engine.insertMatchRecords(groups)
```

### 💬 Step 5: Seed Chat with System Message

Creates welcome message for each group:

```sql
INSERT INTO chat_messages (id, match_id, user_id, content, message_type, created_at)
VALUES (uuid_generate_v4(), [match_id], null,
        '👋 Welcome to your Rounds group! Feel free to introduce yourselves — your shared interests made this match possible.',
        'system', now());
```

```typescript
const seedMessages = await engine.seedChatMessages(groups, matches)
```

### 📩 Step 6: Prepare Notifications

Generates notification targets for each matched user:

```json
{
  "userId": "uuid",
  "email": "doctor@example.com", 
  "firstName": "Sara",
  "groupName": "Rounds_Group_01",
  "groupMembers": ["Dr. Ahmed", "Dr. Omar"]
}
```

**Email Template:**
- Subject: "🎉 You've been matched!"
- Body: "Your Rounds group is live. Head to the chat to meet your fellow doctors!"

```typescript
const notifications = engine.prepareNotifications(groups)
```

### 🧍 Step 7: Handle Unmatched Users

Identifies users who couldn't be placed in valid groups:

```typescript
const rolloverCandidates = engine.handleUnmatchedUsers(eligibleUsers, groups)
```

These users are prioritized for the next Thursday's matching round.

## 🚀 Usage

### Automated CRON Execution

The system runs automatically every Thursday at 16:00 via Vercel CRON:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/weekly-matching",
      "schedule": "0 16 * * 4"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Manual Testing (Development)

```bash
# Test the matching engine
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/weekly-matching

# Run simulation script
npx tsx scripts/simulate_matching_engine.ts
```

### Production Deployment

The CRON job is secured with `CRON_SECRET` environment variable:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/cron/weekly-matching \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```
