# üö® URGENT: RLS Infinite Recursion Fix

## The Problem
Your application is completely broken due to infinite recursion in the `profiles` table RLS policies. This prevents ALL queries to the profiles table from working.

## üîß IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the following SQL commands

### Step 2: Run These SQL Commands (Copy-Paste All at Once)

```sql
-- ============================================
-- URGENT RLS RECURSION FIX
-- ============================================

-- Step 1: Drop ALL existing RLS policies on profiles table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_select_policy" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_insert_policy" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_update_policy" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_delete_policy" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_select_own" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_update_own" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_insert_own" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_delete_own" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for all users" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for authenticated users only" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for users based on user_id" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable delete for users based on user_id" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_policy" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_select" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_modify" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_select_simple" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_insert_simple" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_update_simple" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_delete_simple" ON profiles;

-- Step 2: Create simple, non-recursive RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "profiles_select_simple" ON profiles
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "profiles_insert_simple" ON profiles
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "profiles_update_simple" ON profiles
FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND user_id = auth.uid())
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "profiles_delete_simple" ON profiles
FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND user_id = auth.uid());

-- Step 3: Ensure RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 4: Test the fix
SELECT id, user_id, first_name, last_name FROM profiles LIMIT 1;
```

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
After running the SQL commands, you should see:
- ‚úÖ No error messages
- ‚úÖ A sample profile record returned
- ‚úÖ Your application should start working

## üéØ What This Fix Does

1. **Removes ALL problematic RLS policies** that were causing infinite recursion
2. **Creates simple, safe policies** that:
   - Allow authenticated users to read profiles
   - Allow users to only modify their own profiles
   - Prevent any recursive references
3. **Enables RLS** with the new safe policies
4. **Tests the fix** to ensure it works

## üöÄ After the Fix

1. **Restart your Next.js application**
2. **Test the chat functionality**
3. **Verify user authentication works**
4. **Check that profile queries work**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If You Still Have Issues

If the above doesn't work, try this emergency fix:

```sql
-- EMERGENCY: Temporarily disable RLS (NOT for production)
ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Test query
SELECT id, user_id, first_name, last_name FROM profiles LIMIT 1;

-- Re-enable RLS after testing
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## üìû Support

This fix should resolve the infinite recursion issue immediately. Your chat system and all profile-related functionality should work perfectly after applying this fix.

**The key is to run these SQL commands in your Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor right now.**
